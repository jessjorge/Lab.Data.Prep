\title{Define Dummy Variables}
\usage{
var_def(df, event_tags, cumulative = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe that is being fed into the function. It is essential
that this dataframe be output by the mpc function, also defined in this
package. You may pass in a different dataframe but the format must be
identical to that of an mpc output.}

\item{event_tags}{A dictionary consisting of key value pairs. The
keys should correspond to all unique "event code" entries and the values
should be event names. These names will become the columns of the output
dataframe.}

\item{cumulative}{If set to TRUE, the function will also output columns
that keep track of the total number of times a particular event took place.}

\item{long}{Set to TRUE by default. This argument tells the function to call
the new_med constructor before returning the dataframe.}
}
\value{
This function returns a dataframe x, whose first three columns
are identical to the input dataframe, df, but with additional columns
including dummy variables for unique events and corresponding cumulative
columns.
}
\description{
This function takes a dataframe output by mpc and returns a
new one with dummy variables for each unique event type. The user must pass
in a dictionary specifying what the event types should be.
